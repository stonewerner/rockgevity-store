          <p>Refunds are only offered to customers that receive the wrong items or damaged items. If any of these apply, please contact us at stoneandspencerinc@gmail.com with photos of wrong/damaged items and we'll sort that out for you.</p>

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Can I exchange an item for a different size/color?</h2>
          <p>At this time, we don't offer exchanges. If you're unsure which size would fit better, check out our sizing chartsâ€”we have one for every item listed on our store, in the product description section. Though rare, it's possible that an item you ordered was mislabelled. If that's the case, please let us know at stoneandspencerinc@gmail.com within a week after receiving your order. Include your order number and photos of the mislabeled item, and we'll send you a new one, or issue a refund!</p>
